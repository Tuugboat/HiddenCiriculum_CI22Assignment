This is the writeup for the Hidden Ciriculum assignment.

Note for future self: it might be interesting to compare the lagged weekly employment status with the arrest rate and conviction rate, controlling for race and gender as well.  First attempts at this were complicated since you have to combine the week # with the month # ([1, 52] -> [1, 12]) which was a little outside the scope of this assignment. Might be a good *starting point* for semester-long assignment
